        <p>
          I am a Front-end Web developer from Vancouver, BC Canada. I am excited to bring my extensive knowledge and experience to
          the process of building exceptional websites.Over the past year and a half I have placed my primary focus on learning
          advanced aspects of Front-end web design. Through my studies I have learned the following aspects of building modern
          web sites: responsive mobile-first design all the way though to reactive web applications and API's. The main categories
          of my studies cover html, css, sass, BEM, SMACSS, Javascript, JQuery, node, React, Vue and many additional frameworks
          and libraries.
